<h1>HUSKY</h1>
<p>The Siberian Husky is a breed of medium-sized working sled dog. The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings, and is smaller than the similar-looking Alaskan Malamute. </p>
<h2>Interesting facts</h2>
<p>Born to Run (and Run Efficiently): Huskies were originally bred by the Chukchi people in Siberia to pull light loads over vast distances at moderate speed. They have incredible endurance and a "cool" running style that is highly energy-efficient, allowing them to travel great lengths with minimal food.


The "Great Race of Mercy": In 1925, teams of Siberian Huskies became world-famous for the heroic "Serum Run to Nome." They relayed life-saving diphtheria antitoxin over 600 miles of treacherous Alaskan wilderness to the icebound town of Nome, saving countless lives. The annual Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race commemorates this feat.

The Escape Artist (Houdini Dog): Huskies are renowned for their intelligence and independent, sometimes mischievous, nature. This often manifests as an amazing ability to escape enclosures. They are expert climbers, jumpers, and diggers who view a fence as a personal challenge.

Colorful Eyes: They are one of the few breeds where heterochromia (having two different colored eyes—often one blue and one brown) is common and accepted in their breed standard. Their eyes can also be amber or a mix of colors within the same iris.

Vocal, but Not Barkers: Huskies generally do not bark much. Instead, they are known for their wide range of vocalizations, including the distinctive howl, yodeling, and "talking" (often described as woo-woos or funny grumbling).


A Self-Cleaning, Anti-Odor Coat: Despite their thick, double coat designed to withstand temperatures down to $-76^\circ\text{F}$ ($-60^\circ\text{C}$), they are surprisingly clean. They often groom themselves much like a cat and typically have very little "doggy odor."

<td>The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized working dog renowned for its powerful yet graceful appearance, suggesting both speed and endurance. Their build is compact and agile, characterized by a moderately boned frame that is never heavy or coarse. The Husky's most striking feature is its dense, weather-resistant double coat, which includes a soft, thick undercoat that provides superior insulation against frigid Arctic temperatures. This coat comes in a wide variety of colors, most commonly combinations of black, gray, red, and white, often set off by distinct and compelling head markings that resemble a mask or cap. The head itself is well-proportioned, featuring a pointed muzzle and their signature, thickly-furred, triangular ears that stand naturally erect. Perhaps most captivating are the eyes, which can be almond-shaped, blue, brown, or famously bi-colored (heterochromia). Finally, the dog's alert and spirited nature is often showcased by its heavily furred tail, which is carried in an expressive, upward sickle curve over the back when the dog is excited or at attention.</td>
